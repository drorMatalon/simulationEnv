Simulation environmant:
1. Library that helps modeling signal proccessing chains, espatially designed for communication perpuse.
2. Examples for models can be found under "TestBanches" dir
3. models abstruct design:
  a. SimCore block stors information about the deferent blocks in the signal chain.
  b. blocks are connected together with InGate at the beggining.
  c. Analyzer can be connected to monitor blocks.
